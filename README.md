# laterpay-attic.github.io

(We don't need a site per se but this seemed a good place for an org readme)

## Why?

We've got a bunch of codebases that we don't *quite* want to throw away or delete,
whether because others might use them,
there's historical contextual value,
or maybe we're only 99.99999% sure we're done with them.

Keeping them in the main LaterPay GitHub account is ok,
but it adds noise to code search and casual browsing,
confusion to new people.

Hence the Attic!
